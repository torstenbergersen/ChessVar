# ChessVar
Chess variant portfolio project for introductory computer science class.

This is the portfolio project for CS 162. In I have created a variant of chess that includes two additional pieces, the falcon and the hunter.  To win this version of chess one must capture the king. Also to note, there is no check or checkmate, castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. I have included a script for playing in the terminal, simply uncomment the final block of code.
